# Laplace Equation Solvers (1D & 2D)

This Python project provides analytical and numerical solutions for Laplace’s equation in one and two dimensions. It is intended as a learning and demonstration tool for computational methods in mathematical physics and engineering.

## Features

**1D Laplace Equation**
- Analytical solutions for standard boundary conditions.
- Numerical solutions using finite difference methods.

**2D Laplace Equation**
- Analytical solutions for separable boundary conditions (when applicable).
- Numerical solutions using finite difference methods with iterative solvers (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel).

**Visualization**
 - Plotting of numerical solutions using Matplotlib.
 - Contour and surface plots for 2D solutions.
